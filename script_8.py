'''
Challenge: Implement error handling to ensure that the user enters valid marks (between 0 and 100) for each subject.
=================================================
Input: Ask the user to enter their marks for three subjects.
Processing: Calculate the average of the marks. Determine the grade based on the average:
90 and above: A
80-89: B
70-79: C
60-69: D
Below 60: F
Output: Display the calculated grade.
